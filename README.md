## Abstract
This research project aims to implement a Fixed Parameterized Complexity based algorithm
for the Deletion into small Components Problem with and without heuristical improvements.
The problem states that given a graph G, an integer k and an integer c, the problem checks
whether there exists a deletion set D of size at most k such that every connected component
in G\D has size at most c. This problem is NP complete. It has applications in testing
computer network vulnerability and AI planning.
